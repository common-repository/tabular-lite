Tabular creates semantic HTML tables automatically. No coding required. Simply edit table cells, choose a template, and display!

== Description ==

Tabular is a brand new way to create HTML tables for your WordPress website. Each table is created automatically so no manual coding is required. Simply enter table data, or paste in directly from a spreadsheet, choose your table template, and that's it. You're good to go!

A full demo will be coming soon but click <a href="http://demo.wpgothemes.com/flexr/tabular-demo/" target="_blank">here</a> to see a live demo of a table generated by Tabular, plus the outputted HTML code.

The generated table code is highly semantic in accordance with recommended web standards and best practices. Tabular does all this for you automatically, leaving you to focus on what data you want your table to display, and how it looks.

Create unlimited tables with Tabular. There is no restriction on the number of tables you can create, or the amount of data added to each table.

Super fast table editor! Edit the data for each table just as you would in any spreadsheet software such as Excel. You can even paste in data directly too for convenience, making editing even faster still. Also, the spreadsheet editor supports an undo function to reduce errors and recover deleted data.
